Created new quarto file for Buffalo River Inconnu mortality rate estimates because added some data prep/wrangling code to get data file ready

```{r}
#| label: note - don't need knitr code chunk at the beginning of quarto file to be able to render 
```


```{r}
#| label: load packages
#| include: false

library(tidyverse) #ggplot2 and purrr part of tidyverse
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(fs) # Series of tools to work with file-systems, a bit like {here}

library (FSA)
library(knitr)     # to use kable() function to format tables
library(gt)        # to format tables
```


```{r}
#| label: load data
#| include: false


# Should load raw data and tally catch by age in R

inco <- read_csv(here("data", "buffriv_inco_agefreq.csv"))

str(inco)

print(inco)
```


```{r}
#| label: data prep
#| include: false



```
