library(gt)        # to format tables
library(viridis)   # colours better on plots for colour-blind people

## recommend using the comment-based syntax (#|) vs. chunk options on the first line (e.g. ```{r, echo = FALSE}) to make documents more portable and consistent across execution engines https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
